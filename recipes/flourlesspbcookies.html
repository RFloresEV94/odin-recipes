<h4>Ingredients</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>1 cup natural peanut butter</li>
    <li>1 cup sugar</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
    <li>1 large egg, lighly beaten</li>
    <li>Coarse sea salt, for sprinkling</li>
  </ul>

<br>

<h4>Instructions</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and place the racks 
        in the upper and lower third of the oven. </li>
    <li> In a medium bowl, mix the peanut butter, sugar, vanilla 
        and egg until well combined. Spoon 1 tablespoon of the 
        mixture about 1 inch apart <br>onto ungreased baking sheets. 
        Flatten the mounds with the tines of a fork, making a 
        crosshatch pattern on the cookies. Sprinkle coarse salt 
        on top of the cookies. </li>
    <li>Bake until golden around the edges, about 10 minutes, 
        switching the position of the sheets halfway through baking. 
        Transfer to racks to cool. Repeat with the remaining dough. </li>
  </ol>
